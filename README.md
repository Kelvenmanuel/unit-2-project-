 1.Planning

 ### Definition of the Problem 
 In 2050, The company Explore wants to explore other planets, on the other hand, the communication nowadays still uncertain. they have 3 station one in the Earth that can only communicate using Morse code, the second station in the Moon can only communicate in Binary and the final station in Mars that they need us to provide a channel of communication. 
 
 ### Proposed Solution 
 
 ### success criteria
 
 • Communication between the 2 station Earth and Mars using Morse code; 
 • Communication between Mars and the Moon uses Binary code;
 • find a communication system that allow stations to communicate completely using English 
 • Keyboard input on each station is limited to 2push buttons. 
 • 100W lights are buzzers are available
