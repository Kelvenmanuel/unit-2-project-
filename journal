04/11/2019, we began with the unit 2 project and it is about communication, we have kin of limited sources and we need to achieve a goal, I really like the new chalenge and I will do my best to complete this program even though is kind of far of my comfort zone  

Evaluate/compare between Bash and Arduino
A: In the first mounths at ISAK we learned how to use Bash and I am used to using it but now Arduinpo has been introduced to us, even though I do not know much about it I think that Arduino is easier then Bash, when we are checking the program in Arduino we just need the press one "button" and will check faster, by itself and will tell you exactly what is missing as well
on the other hand in bash we need to save the program first then see if it is working, if is not working the terminal will only show you the line that is wrong and do not give more specific details than Arduino, so to check if a program is working we take more time in bash than Arduino. In Arduino the algorithms are more precise and this altready has basic data like loop and funtions.
Some bad things about Arduino are that there are a lot of varioble types, the variables are more complicated and less intuitive than Bash one good think about bash is that it is connect to terminal and file system,
Even though Arduino have a lot of variable types, in arduino teh sintex is clear and specific and we have a precise explanion about this variables. 

11/11/19, today was the second day about our unit 2 project, I get more knowledge about Arduino and we do the traffic light with the codes in the arduino connecting the data on Arduino inside my computer to the physical Arduino Uno R3 for my was fantastic feeling that I done it, I really do not feel comfortable yet with this all new stuff but as soon as posible I will get all of this, Arduino and Tinkercad and I hpe I will do I great unit 2 project.

the VOID keybord is used only in function declarations it indicates that the funtion is expected to return no information to the function from which it was called;
INT integers are your primary data-types for number storage. 

13/11/19 Today we use Arduino and we create a binary sequence for traffic lights, Even though was not the point I learned how to make the light blink and I am getting more knowledge about Arduino. 

19/11/19 Today we did some binary to decimal conversion exercises and vice versa, I got more knowledge about what we will do in the next classes, I learned how the bases work, I have some doubts about the programming I'm still not confident about it, the teacher introduced us OR AND NOT and XOR and we start the process of making the circuits with their symbols

20/11/19 today we texted about the new codes and graphics we made where we had to draw the table, the equation and we had a question where we had to use knowledge througohout the classes to think like a computer

21/11/19 Today we continue to make the circuits with the respective tables and start working with the lights translating them into numbers, first we take the table, where we could see if to form a number which lamps would have to be turned on, after that we took the equations that later we would have to translate into Arduino codes

22/11/19 today we We continued the process of 7 lights where we had to put the codes in Arduino and build the system with Arduino, today I managed to remove some of the doubts that I had presented in previous classes and managed to overcome some weaknesses

25/11/19 today we start a new tast about english input system, where we use to 2 buttons to get the inputs, letters and number, was a good lesson and in the end Nomnso shared his idea and we all start to see if it is something wrong and how we can develop his idea 

27/11/19 We did some IB questions, we convert number decimal to Hexadecimal, I learn how to use it and we strat a new task 

02/12/19 today we discussed about computer ARCH. we began and we were doing new tasks about english input systems where we try to build the circuit and try to introduce a messange using the codes that we had to update or change. 

06/01/20 Today we keep the process for complete the unit 2 and 3 project, I could work in my code, add things that I needed to add, some questions that I have is about the swith case, there are a couple of things that I have to change in my code and I am not sure about the next step. Addictionaly we start programming in C language, I liked the language, for me was quite easy to understand and I will see some videos and research about this to get ready for yhe lesson, for now I do not have any question

08/01/20 Today we start a list of exercise, even though I got stuck for a while in the first exercise, then I could undrstand and the rest of the exercise I did not get stuck as much as the first exercise, I will finish the exercise and  I believe that when I finish all of the exercise I would get more knowledge about C programming and about programming in geral
